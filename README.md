# FINDING COLLEGES FOR MARIA

## Introduction

This is a data wrangling and data cleaning project which uses three disparate datasets to filter out all the colleges based on certain conditions.

## Problem Statement

Maria, a 25-year old US Army veteran, has just returned to the civilian workforce and is looking for suitable colleges to pursue a degree in Management Systems and Information Technology.

The task is to create a dataset of colleges, with rankings, subject to the following criteria:
The colleges must be in:
- be in an urban/metropolitan area.
- be in a city that ranks 75th percentile or higher on Kauffman's start-up rankings.
- be below 50th percentile in overall crime.
- offer a 2-year or 4-year degree in Information Technology/Science.

## Data and other Files

- Kauffman's start-up rankings are present in a CSV file called Startup Activity.csv
- All other data can be found [here](https://data.world/exercises/data-wrangling-exercise-1).
- Files named LocalCrimeTrends.pdf and FullDataDocumentation.pdf explains data in the crime and college datasets.

## Requirements

The project was done in Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.
